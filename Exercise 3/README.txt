Requirements

Write a move assignment operator for the polynomial. Define the copy constructor as default. To test whether your assignment is used write a function polynomial f(double c2, double c1, double c0) that takes three coefficients and returns a polynomial. Print out a message in your move assignment or use a debugger to make sure your assignment is used.
