Exercise 6: Iterator of a Vector

Requirements

Add the methods begin() and end() for returning a begin and end iterator to class vector. Add the types iterator and const_iterator to the class as well. Note that pointers are models of the concept of random-access iterators. Use the STL function sort for ordering vector entries to demonstrate that your iterators work as they should.

Stack over- or underflow must throw an exception
